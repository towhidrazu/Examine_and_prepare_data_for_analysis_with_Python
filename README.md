# Examine_and_prepare_data_for_analysis_with_Python

This project has been done as part of Course 2: Get Started with Python of Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

In this project, I examine a dataset of New York City Taxi Rides with Pandas, a popular data analysis tool of the Python programming language, and prepare it for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Some of the functions I used here are:

- shape
- info
- describe
- sort_values
- groupby
- aggregate
